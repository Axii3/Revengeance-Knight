# Revengeance Knight
 
This is a little game I worked on since 2024.

I don't plan on updating it any further.

You can explore the forrest and the castle on the hill.

I experimented with the environment and how to create an atmosphere. I was inspired by games like Skyrim and ps1 style graphics(like silent hill but not specifically).

I also coded an inventory system that you can open with 'esc'.
The icons for the icons were made by me in blender.
You can select items, read the description and place them in other slots.

The music was also composed by me.
